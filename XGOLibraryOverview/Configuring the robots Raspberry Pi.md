# How to Configure the Robots Firm/Software

# WARNING ONLY DO THIS IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH RASPBERRY PIS
(I am not responsible for any damage caused to the robot, you follow this at your own choice, ill be giving a general understanding of it.)

# Step 1
Plug a USB extender (one where it can plug into the screen and allow multiple inputs of USB-C)
Connect a mouse, monitor and keyboard USBs to this.

# Step 2
Turn the robot on and it should just start up with the raspberry PI OS imager.
(if not then you need to do the advanced configuration i'll make down at the bottom)

# Step 3
Go to the directory and in it you will see root, inside root you can make new folders and such,

for e.g I used it to upload videos of animes and got the robot to play the video on the screen and output the audio.

# Step 4
Save, and unplug, then turn off the robot and turn back on again.

# Advanced Configuration
(NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOUR SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING)
(Again I am not responsible for any damage caused im just giving a brief explaination.)

# Step One
You need to take the shell of the robot off, ensure its powered off then unscrew the screws and take the top off

# Step Two
Unplug the LCD and plug in a HDMI lead

# Step Three
Plug into your computer and it should come up as a HDD

# Step Four
Do the steps in the basic config (steps 3-4)

# Step Five
Replug the LCD screen back in
Then screw the shell back onto the Robot and turn it off and on again
Now your good to go
