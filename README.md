# XGO2-Mini Python Projects
this is some projects i made for the XGO-mini robot as I couldn't find any public so here's a library of ones ive already made, but ill upload to github

(IMPORTANT) I am unsure if this works with any of their other robots as I only have the latest XGO2-Mini Robot.

After you get into the blocky section and have entered the IP of your robot, clear any of the blocks you have inputted, then click "code" and clear anything in there and paste in one of these codes from the library to use.
