# XGO2-Mini-Python-Projects
this is some projects i made for the XGO-mini robot as I couldn't find any public so here's a library

After you get into the blocky section and have entered the IP of your robot, clear any of the blocks you have inputted, then click "code" and clear anything in there and paste in one of these codes from the library to use.
